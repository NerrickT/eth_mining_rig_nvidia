# ETH Mining Rig for NVIDIA Graphics Cards


This is a simple python script that is used to start ETH mining cards that are running on the Claymore Mining application.

  - Must be running NVIDIA Cards for this to work
  - Python 2 or Python 3
  - It is a forgone conclusion that the overclocking app used is nvidia-setting on Ubunut Linux

# New Features to be added!

  - Script to be added @reboot from cron
  - config for AMD/ATI Cards
